Figuring out an idea of what I wanted my function to do was the hardest part during Div I. I was uncertain about what I wanted to code and the purpose of the function that it took me a while to start. I felt like I needed to have some idea before starting or trying out anything in R, which was a mistake. I mistakenly avoided my computer and trying out whatever came to mind. I didn't properly brainstorm. Instead, it wasn't until I thought I had a "worthy" idea that I actually started to write the code. Moving forward, I plan to "free-write" right away since its such an essential part of program development. A "free-write" also may allow more room for editing and debugging. 

I felt like more and more problems arosed as I went along coding my function. As a result, my function ended up looking differently than I thought it would. This process made me realized how important is to think of different inputs and each of their respective outputs beforehand as much as possible. I have coded in other programming languages in the past and thought writing for-loops is no big deal; however, knowing more about how R works allows you to take advantage of its methods like `case_when()`. 

I realized that I have a lot of more tools to code and develop. Realizing this gives me more confidence to tackle on more programming tasks in the future.
